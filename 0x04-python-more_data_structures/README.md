> # More on Data Structures
+ Herein, we have more information on manipulation of lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries.
+ Calling methods to various structures.
+ Using the lists as queues, stacks, nesting and also comprehensions.
+ Under the list comprehensions we have map, filter functions and also the lambda.
 >> e.g list(map(lambda x: x**2 for x in range(1, 10)))
   This produces a square of all values in the range as [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
